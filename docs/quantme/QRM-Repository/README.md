# QRM Repository

In the following the structure of a QRM repository as well as its configuration and usage is shown.

### Configuration

The QRM repository must be a publicly accessible Github repository. 
It can be configured using the [configuration file](../../../resources/plugins/QuantME-ClientPlugin/client/Config.js).
Therefore, `githubUsername` should be used to configure the username or organisation name under which the Github repository is located.
Further, `githubRepositoryName` has to specify the name of the Github repository.
